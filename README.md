# Sprov AI
 Sprov AI is an innovative speech coaching application designed to elevate soft skills through AI-powered analysis and feedback. The app utilizes the Gemini Pro model from Google's Generative AI suite to create comprehensive and personalized speech analysis reports.

The Gemini API plays a crucial role in interpreting these data points and generating detailed feedback. It helps by synthesizing complex speech analysis into actionable insights and recommendations for improvement, enhancing user engagement by providing a dynamic, interactive learning experience. The app also identifies patterns such as stuttering or monotonous delivery and suggests exercises to improve fluency and expressiveness. Designed for professionals and students alike, Sprov AI aims to help users refine their communication abilities, ensuring they can deliver impactful and clear speech in any setting.
